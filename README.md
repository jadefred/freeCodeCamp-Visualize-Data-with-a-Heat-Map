# [freeCodeCamp - Visualize Data with a Heat Map](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map)

# About

It is a project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification - [Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/).

This project requires us to create a heat map by using the dataset provided by freeCodeCamp with D3 which is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/JEXgeY?editors=1010)

# Technologies

- Using **D3.js library** to build a scatterplot graph
